# Lutris Metadata/Cover image scraper

This is a lutris cover and banner image scraper which gets data from VNDB/DLSite and has a GUI to use.
Tested on Steam Deck and works perfectly. Can help add Visual Novel covers to lutris and when adding it as a Non-Steam game, the cover will also be applied
Please change config.yaml settings and use GUI to update cover image.

## TODO
Github binary CI build
